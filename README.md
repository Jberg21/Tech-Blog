## Description

> Challenge #14 Tech Blog MVC

## Introduction 
This week we were instructed to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

## Challenges

Mysql has given me big headaches with my mac and it being rejected.

---
## Victories

MVC model approach and how it all functions together was really intereting to me. I like that its a pretty standard set up and it was extremely helpful to be able to have the module assignments to reference back on this project.
